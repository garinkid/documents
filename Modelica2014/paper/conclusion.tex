\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}
In this paper, the development of Modelica model for the youBot manipulator is presented.
The Modelica library for the manipulator components provides the user with modularity, reusability and abstraction.
The model accuracy has been evaluated through a comparison test with the actual system.
The test result shows that the model reflects the actual system within a reasonable deviation. 
Possible improvements for the developed Modelica library is the development of a more accurate motor model and a more comprehensive evaluation of the manipulator component (controller components, power consumption and dynamic properties of every rigid body model).
The manipulator model is planned to be tested with other Modelica tools (OpenModelica, jModelica) and used for hardware-in-the-loop experiments.
The development or design of other manipulator models is also possible through the reusability of the components model in the Modelica library.
The library is publicly available\youbot-store to be used for education or research involving manipulator dynamics, load identification, fault analysis and motion control.

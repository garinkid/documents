  abstract = {Establishing mobile manipulation as a powerful key technology for
	the cognitive factory requires mobile manipulation platforms, which
	at the same time pay attention to industrial requirements, meet requirements
	of education and research and last, but not least, come with a decent
	price tag. KUKA has recently launched a major research and development
	effort towards designing a mobile manipulation platform that meets
	these requirements and can serve as a reference plat form for industry,
	research and education at the same time. Although the initiative
	has just left the starting blocks, a first off-spring, the KUKA youBot,
	an omni-directional mobile manipulator has just seen the light of
	day. In this paper we report on the development of the first prototypes.},

  abstract = {Modelica is an object-oriented language for modeling of large, complex
	and heterogeneous physical systems. It is suited for multi-domain
	modeling, e.g., for modeling of mechatronics including cars, aircraft
	and industrial robots which typically consist of mechanical, electrical
	and hydraulic subsystems as well as control systems. General equations
	are used for modeling of the physical phenomena. No particular variable
	needs to be solved manually, the Modelica tools have enough information
	to do that automatically. The language has been designed to allow
	tools to generate efficient code automatically. The modeling effort
	is thus reduced considerably since model components can be reused
	and tedious and error-prone manual manipulations are not needed.
	The principles of object-oriented modeling and the details of the
	Modelica language as well as several examples are presented},
